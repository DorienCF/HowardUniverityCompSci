Prior to runinng the program you will need to have a .txt file and enough space to store one .json file.
this program is approbimately 95% operable.Note there is a math error that does not allow the program to change the character date back to text.The program oppersates correctly it is seems
to be an issue with the algorithm.* 

- Procedure to test.
--Encryption:
1.) Run the  .py file in an interpeter
2.) enter the path of the .txt file that you wish to test
3.) enter e or encrypt (not case sensitive).
4.) will recive a file ______.encrypted.json
--Decryption:
1.) Run the  .py file in an interpeter
2.) enter the path of the .txt file that you wish to test
3.) enter e or encrypt (not case sensitive).
4.) will recive a file ______.txt.encrypted.json.DECRYPTED.txt

** Ensure to download the "Encryption_functions.py" file as well. this file doesn't change the requirements doc. is just a more affective way I found to write the code. ***
